<h1>Strings - Pins and Needles</h1>
<h3>To iterate through daily_sales string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.
</h3>


<p> The cashier's daily responsibilities involves tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers 
</p>

<br>
<p><b>PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>The shop has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.</p>

<p>All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. 
</p>

<br>

<p><b>TASK </b></p>
<p>Iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.</p>

<li>Break up 'daily_sales' into easy to understand lists `customers`, `sales`, and `threads_sold`.</li>

<li>Determine the total value of the day's sales.</li>

<li>Find out how much thread of any specific color was sold</li>
